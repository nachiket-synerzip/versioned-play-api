Trial Play REST API versioning
=====================================

Trying out versioning in Java Play framework. There are two versions (v1 and v2) which are specified through the URL.
The main controller checks the version number and accordingly invokes the service for V1 or V2.
V2 is inherited from V1. The extra features, bug fixes etc for V1 can be added in V2 class.
