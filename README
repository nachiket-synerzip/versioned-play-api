Trial Play REST API versioning
=====================================

Trying out versioning in Java Play framework. There are two versions (v1 and v2) which are supposed to be accessed mainly through the URL.
The main controller checks the version number and invokes the service for V1 or V2 accordingly.
V2 is inherited from V1. The extra features, bug fixes etc can be added in V2 class.
